# plesk_mail_autoconfig
This code is not recommended for live production as I am still testing it. Use at your own risk. 

This script for Plesk servers allows you to deploy automatic mail client configuration for:

- Thunderbird autoconfig
- Outlook autodiscover
- Apple iOS 4 or later and Mac OS X 10.8 or later (config file generator)
- I revised the author's code for my own use.
